Hi! My name is Marc Alexandre, I'm a French Software Engineer. I've been Full Stack for more than 5 years at LumApps, and I am currently searching for a new company. This blog is just random thoughts about my work, side projects, the tech community and the stacks I'm using. If you want to get in touch with me, you can send me an [email](mailto:blog@malexandre.fr) or mention me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/thagou).
