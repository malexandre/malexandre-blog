Two weeks ago, my 3 months notice came to an end, I left LumApps after 5 years and a half. I was the first employee back then, but it was time for me to go see something else. I just signed a new contract with a new French startup as a full remote employee. Since remote jobs is still not the norm, I want to share how I organized my search to find one, since I really wanted to go full remote.

## Just another project

First, a preface. I have two dream companies: [Buffer] and [Doist]. Their culture and product are awesome, and I applied to each one as soon as I gave my 3 months notice. Everything else in this post can be applied to my process with them too, except the "finding a job opportunity" and the "searching to know the company" parts.

In a previous post, I spoke about my [Todoist organization]({{< ref "my-todoist-weekly-routine.md" >}}) to keep me productive. It was also the centerpiece of my job search. I like to focus on one personal project at a time, and for the last 2 months it was my job search. First, I created a recurring task, 3 times a week at 1 PM (in the middle of my lunch break), I had to go through a list of job boards focus on remote ones. Here they are, with a direct link to the engineering filter when available:

- [Remotive](https://remotive.io/find-a-job/#s=1)
- [WeWorkRemotely](https://weworkremotely.com/categories/2-programming/jobs#intro)
- [RemoteOk](https://remoteok.io/remote-dev-jobs)
- [WorkingNomads](https://www.workingnomads.co/jobs?category=development)
- [WFH](https://www.wfh.io/categories/1-remote-software-development/jobs)

The last two also manage freelance contracts, and since I wanted to join a new company, they were less useful than the firsts.

For each one, the first time I went through the list for the last 2 months, and for each interesting offer I created a task with the website page (see the screenshot below from the [Todoist Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/todoist-to-do-list-and-ta/jldhpllghnbhlbpcmnajkpdmadaolakh?hl=en)), managing a priority between p2 as "I WANT THIS JOB" to p4 "sounds really interesting technically but the product does not motivates me". Then, once I was done with the 2 months backlog, going through the sites every 2 days took me just a few minutes, and added in average 2 offers to my tasks.

## Can't get no application

Then, 3 times a week I would take one of top priority task in my job project and apply to it. An application takes a long time. Everytime I searched long enough to get an idea about the culture of the company, its communication and most of the time its products. Sometimes, after doing all this research, I decided that the company was not that interesting, and push the priority to p4 if it was higher or completed the task if it was already a p4. And then retry on another high priority offer. Once I grasped the identity of the company, I started writing a customized cover letter. Of course some parts were kept from one to another, especially when I described some past experiences, but even that might need to focus more on certain aspect depending on the application. Sometimes I also personalized my resume, but since I applied mostly to some equivalent jobs, most of the time I did not need to.

For each application, as soon as I sent it, I would create a task 2 weeks later to check again if there was no response, except when the process was clearly stated on the site/blog of the company and said they answered in more than 2 weeks. Some application required more than just a resume & a cover letter. Sometimes a video of you talking, a technical test through Hacker Rank or something more custom, etc. I'll talk about what I think about this later in the post.

And each time I got an answer, I added a task for the next step, be it a video chat interview, a phone call, a technical tests. And again, right after the next steps, I would add a new task for the next one or a "follow up" task if I sent a message and waited a response. It might seem like a lot of process but not really. I kept myself from sending to much applications at the same time to not be overwhelmed, and the recurring tasks in Todoist really helped smooth everything a lot.

## There is a lot of fish in the sea

Besides my active search, I also joined a remote slack (and more) community, [Remotive](https://remotive.io/). It's really an awesome community, with great advices on how to gear up for remote work, how to organize yourself, but also just a friendly community with discussions about everything and nothing. I also found some job openings on the #jobs channel that I did not see at all on the job boards.

I also joined [Hired.com] and [Talent.io]. Not really a success for me, I'm not sure why. My talent advocate from [Talent.io] told me that companies mostly search for junior engineers on the platform. I only had one meeting through both the sites, and it resulted in a contract proposition, but I was not interested by the technical environement nor the product, too bad.

I created an account on [Angel.co], and surprisingly, I had more contacts in it than [Hired.com] or [Talent.io]. And it's through [Angel.co] that the company I'm joining found me, by themselves. I was also contacted on linkedin by a few people from [Angel.co] for some job openings or just some hackathlon. Finally, I also got a lot of contacts through linkedin, but mostly the usual noise with recruiters fishing almost randomly, like a lot asking me about my Java experience from 5 years ago.

And finally, don't forget your friends & relations. [Jo](https://medium.com/@djo) helped me a lot, always giving me new companies to discover and apply to, and listening or reading about my adventures. Lucile, from Doist, took a lot of her time to help me make my cover letters better on the Remotive community. Old coworkers gave my contact to interesting recruiters that contacted them. This time I was found by the company, but last time it was through Jo that I found my job at LumApps. You're never alone.

## The Good, The Bad and the Process

A lot of a remote companies have a long process to review the applications and make sure its a perfect fit. It was interesting to discover most of them. Shoutout to those who explain the process publicly like [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) or [HotJar](https://www.hotjar.com/), but most of the times it's explained in the first mail or the first interview, that's nice too. Some process I did not like, others were so fun it was like a game for me. For example, I hate having to make a video of me. I think I'm not a bad speaker (at least the talks I gave and courses I teached were well received), I also like to discuss and thus I am kind of good at interviews. But I can't for the life of me look alive while I'm recording a video of me. In the other hand, the application form from [close.io](https://close.io/) was quite fun to complete.

I have only one big complaint about my last two months. Sometimes, I went through a long process to finally be rejected. I did a lot of interviews, home projects, or anything else. But almost everytime, I was given no reason to why I was not kept by the company. Frankly, if someone take the time to make a 10 hours project for you, to show you they can code, they can conceive a small application, the least you can do is give a reason why you think this not a good fit. I was so pissed sometimes to receive just a "we will not continue the process with you" mail an nothing more after taking so much of my time for the application. I know companies receive a lot of applications, and I'm not saying to give a reason for every resume you reject, but at least for those applications where you asked a lot. Especially when the candidate ask to know why.

The exception to the rule was [Doist]. Allan, who managed my application, was nice enough to answer me and even re-evaluate my application. Coincidentally, the other company that took the time to give me a clear answer was the French startup [Alan](https://alan.eu/), as Charles, the CTO, replied to my mails giving me the reason why he chose not to work with me.

## Remote is the future, at least for me

And that's all my process and my experience of it for the last two months. It was a fun ride, one that I wish to not have to do again anytime soon. I had 3 contracts offered to me, 2 really interesting. I was rejected because my public profile was not Python enough (enven though it's the language I know the most, just ahead of JavaScript), or because I screwed up an interview (the only interview I ever screwed up, and it was for a company that really interested me), or because of no reasons (at least I was never told). But now it's signed, I'm joining FairJungle to start the company. It's my first full remote job, my first node job, and my first react job. A lot of firsts! But I'm really pleased to join them, and with all the discussions we had, I'm sure it's going to be an awesome adventure.
